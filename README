Misc: Possibly incorrectly located classes and exceptions.  

Logging: provides a simple and robust application logging system -- potentially may switch to Log4Net at a later time, though that seems too complex for our needs.

Registry: provides access to the standard Sims 3 registry entries for application discovery and locale validation.

Sims3: provides versions of the math classes used by TS3.
